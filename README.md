# Advanced Gallery

The Advanced Gallery App is a powerful image management tool that allows users to store, organize, and visualize images along with their geographical location. This app provides a seamless way to manage a collection of images enriched with location metadata and displays an interactive map to visualize where each photo was captured.

Key Features:
Image Storage with Metadata:

Automatically captures and stores images along with GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Users can add titles or descriptions to images for better organization.
Location-Based Visualization:

Displays a small map view of the location where each image was taken using the Google Maps API.
Provides a clear geographical context for the stored images, allowing users to visually explore their image collection based on location.
Local Storage with SQLite:

All images, along with their metadata (location, title, date), are stored locally using SQLite.
This ensures fast access to stored data and the ability to search images by location or description.
Interactive Map Features:

Users can view each image's location on the map.
Maps are fully interactive, allowing users to zoom in/out to get a better view of the location.
Search and Filter Functionality:

Search for images based on their location or title.
Provides easy navigation through large collections of photos.
Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Built using Flutter, the app runs seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
